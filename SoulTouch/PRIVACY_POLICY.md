## FreshTrack: Privacy policy

Welcome to FreshTrack, the latest offering from Eye-Catching Software for Android!

As a dedicated Android user, I place a high priority on privacy and data security. I fully understand the frustration and concern that arises when applications collect personal data without explicit user consent. In developing this app, I have ensured that user privacy is treated with the utmost importance. Our app only requests necessary permissions and transparently informs users about data usage, adhering to best practices and regulatory standards to protect user information.

### Data Management in the Application

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (like first name/last name or any product category/category/product information) created by the user is stored locally in your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No analytics software is present in the app either.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

| Permission | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| `android.permission.CAMERA` | The Google ML Kit Barcode Scanner uses the device's camera to capture images of barcodes. Without the camera permission, the app cannot access the camera, making barcode scanning impossible. For real-time scanning, the barcode scanner continuously uses the camera to detect and decode barcodes in the camera's field of view. This requires ongoing access to the camera stream. |

Should you encounter any security vulnerabilities resulting from my actions or have inquiries regarding the privacy measures implemented in the app, please don't hesitate to contact me via email or initiate a discussion on GitHub. Your feedback is invaluable, and I am dedicated to promptly addressing any concerns you may have and providing assistance or resolving issues as required.
