## FreshTrack: Privacy policy

Welcome to FreshTrack, the latest offering from Eye-Catching Software for Android!

As a dedicated Android user, I place a high priority on privacy and data security. I fully understand the frustration and concern that arises when applications collect personal data without explicit user consent. In developing this app, I have ensured that user privacy is treated with the utmost importance. Our app only requests necessary permissions and transparently informs users about data usage, adhering to best practices and regulatory standards to protect user information.

### Data Management in the Application

I hereby state, to the best of my knowledge and belief, that I have not programmed this app to collect any personally identifiable information. All data (like first name/last name or any product category/category/product information) created by the user is stored locally in your device only, and can be simply erased by clearing the app's data or uninstalling it. No analytics software from my side is present in the app either.

### Explanation of permissions requested in the app

| Permission | Why it is required |
| :---: | --- |
| `android.permission.CAMERA` | The Google ML Kit Barcode Scanner uses the device's camera to capture images of barcodes. Without the camera permission, the app cannot access the camera, making barcode scanning impossible. For real-time scanning, the barcode scanner continuously uses the camera to detect and decode barcodes in the camera's field of view. This requires ongoing access to the camera stream. |

### Use of Third-Party Services

Our app utilizes the Google ML Kit Barcode Scanner to scan barcodes and extract relevant information. This service is provided by Google, and it involves the processing of certain data.

### What data is processed

- The input data (e.g., live images from your device camera) is processed entirely on-device. ML Kit does not send this data to Google servers.
- From time to time, the ML Kit APIs may contact Google servers to receive updates such as bug fixes, updated models, and hardware accelerator compatibility information.
- The ML Kit APIs also send metrics about the performance and utilization of the APIs in your app to Google. Google uses this metrics data to measure performance, debug, maintain and improve the APIs, and detect misuse or abuse, as further described in their Privacy Policy (https://policies.google.com/privacy).

| Data | The ML Kit SDK collects... |
| :---: | --- |
| `Device information` | Device information (such as manufacturer, model, OS version and build) and available ML hardware accelerators. Used for diagnostics and usage analytics. |
| `Application information` | Package name and app versions. Used for diagnostics and usage analytics. |
| `Device or other identifiers` | Per-installation identifiers that are not intended to uniquely identify a user or physical device. Used for diagnostics and usage analytics. |
| `Performance metrics` | Performance metrics (such as latency). Used for diagnostics and usage analytics. |
| `API configuration` | API configuration (such as image format and resolution). Used for diagnostics and usage analytics. |
| `Event type` | Event type (such as feature initializations, model downloads, detection, resource releases). Used for diagnostics and usage analytics. |
| `Error codes` | Error code for feature events (such as feature initializations, model downloads, detection, resource releases). Used for diagnostics and usage analytics. |

### Purpose of data processing:
The data processed by the Google ML Kit Barcode Scanner is used solely for the purpose of scanning and interpreting barcodes within our app to provide you with the intended functionality.

### Third-Party Terms and Privacy Policy:
For more detailed information on how Google handles data and protects your privacy, please refer to Google's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy:

- https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/terms

### User Consent:
By using our app, you consent to the processing of your data as described in this privacy policy and in accordance with Google's Terms of Service and Privacy Policy. If you do not agree to these terms, you should not use the app.

Should you encounter any security vulnerabilities resulting from my actions or have inquiries regarding the privacy measures implemented in the app, please don't hesitate to contact me via email or initiate a discussion on GitHub. Your feedback is invaluable, and I am dedicated to promptly addressing any concerns you may have and providing assistance or resolving issues as required.
